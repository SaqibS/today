# Today - Print Today's Appointments

This is a simple utility I wrote for myself so that I could quickly check my Outlook calendar from the command line.

This program requires that Outlook be installed on your computer. As is, it actually requires Outlook 2013, since that is the version I am using. However, if you want to use it, you can delete/re-add the reference to the "Microsoft Outlook Primary Interop Assemblies". If anyone else finds this useful, and if I get time, it would be possible to rewrite the code using late-binding, so that a standalone executable could be distributed. However, that's a non-trivial change.
